Create the GitHub Pricing page layout up to and including the "Additional add-ons" section using HTML5 and CSS3.
Focus on: 
Hero section with headline ("Try the Copilot-powered platform"), description text, and CTA button
Three pricing tier cards (Free, Team, Enterprise) displayed side-by-side
Additional add-ons section with 6 add-on cards in a grid layout
You do not need to replicate: the navigation bar, customer logos carousel, testimonials, feature comparison table, or footer.
